A warm welcome to  my github  ðŸ’»


I am a motivated DevOps Engineer with over 3 + years of hands-on experience in designing, automating, and managing scalable cloud infrastructure. My expertise spans AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible, and ArgoCD, with a strong focus on CI/CD pipelines, GitOps deployments, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
Over the past two years, I have worked on projects involving containerisation, deployment automation, GitOps using ArgoCD, and infrastructure provisioning with Terraform and Ansible. I also have experience in monitoring and observability using Prometheus and Grafana, and in scripting automation with Python and Bash on Linux and Windows Server environments.
I am proficient in Jenkins essentials for end-to-end CI/CD pipeline automation and have implemented GitOps workflows using ArgoCD, enabling seamless and reliable application delivery. Additionally, I follow Agile methodologies and use Jira for sprint planning, tracking, and team collaboration, ensuring timely and efficient project delivery.
